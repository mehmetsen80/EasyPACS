A new open-source dicom listener PACS Server build with DCM4CHE tools","body":"### Welcome to EasyPACS.\r\nEasy PACS allows you to setup a PACS Server which you can view your dicom images online. It uses DCM4CHE tools with the latest frameworks such as Spring Boot. No need to setup a server anymore, the jar file is the file you only need and it contains the web-server itself. Thanks to Spring Boot, it enables the jar file to become both a listener (server) and web at the same time. \r\n\r\n### [Download EasyPACS v0.1 jar file from here](https://2kere2beseder.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/easy-pacs-0-0-1-snapshot.zip)\r\n\r\nThe server accepts all the dicom files and produces all the required database entities. Dicom entity structure is known as:\r\n```\r\nPatient --> NxStudy --> MxSeries --> ZxInstances \r\n1 Patient can contain N of Studies, \r\n1 Study can contain M of Series\r\n1 Series can contain Z of Instances\r\n```\r\n    \r\n### How to Setup Java Environment\r\nJava platform is tricky.
